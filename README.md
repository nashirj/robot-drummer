# robot-drummer
Potential UCF Honors Undergraduate Thesis/Senior Design project

ideal: robot jazz drummer that comps effectively.

potential learning process: large temporal dataset pairing solos (e.g. horn/piano/etc) with drum comping. also need vocab of the great drummers.

the physical implementation should be a plug and play solution that can be placed onto basically any drumset with no extreme structural modification to the drumset. adjusting cymbal stand heights/etc is ok.

challenging to have good feel/dynamics/phrasing

maybe be able to "read" and play different styles?
- start with sightreading verbatim, translating directly to actuation signals
- sightread drum chart, first noting the "style", then playing in the style, and catching hits and stuff musically
